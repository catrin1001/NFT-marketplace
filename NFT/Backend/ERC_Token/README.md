This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a ERC-721 token contract, a test for that contract, a scripts that deploys that contract on Rinkeby.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat compile
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network Rinkeby
```
